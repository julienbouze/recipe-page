## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework


### What I learned

I learned the use of flex directions, margin auto and unique borders


### Continued development

I want to keep improving my Tailwind skills. I want to be able to create any website without editing CSS directly.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Flex direction](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-direction) - This helped me to discover how to change style of component if it is hovered
